Developer Quick Start
=====================
Note that these commands should be invoked within the root of the repository.

**Linux**

1) Run `sudo ./bootstrap.sh ..`

    This will need to happen once per machine or after a repository has moved to a different directory. Note that `sudo` is not necessary when running within a Docker container.

2) Run `source ./Activate.sh x64`

    This will need to happen each time a new terminal window is opened.

**Windows**

1) Run `bootstrap.cmd ..`

    This will need to happen once per machine or after a repository has moved to a different directory.

2) Run `Activate.cmd x64`

    This will need to happen each time a new terminal window is opened.

Useful Development Commands
---------------------------

The following commands are available within an activated terminal window.

Name            | Command                   | Description
----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
DevEnvScripts   | `DevEnvScripts.sh|.cmd`   | Lists all scripts available in the activated environment.
Builder         | `Builder.sh|.cmd`         | Builds C++, Python, C#, etc. files; invoked by the CI machine.
Tester          | `Tester.sh|.cmd`          | Tests C++, Python, C#, etc. files; invoked by the CI machine.
Formatter       | `Formatter.sh|.cmd`       | Formats C++ and Python source files. (Coming Soon)

Invoking CMake
--------------

Native code is built via [CMake](https://cmake.org/). The following commands can be used to build any folder that contains a `CMakeLists.txt` file.
In each example, create a `build` directory that will contain the generated CMake content and eventual binaries.

Assumed directory structure:

    | - <Workspace dir>
        | - CMakeLists.txt
        | - ...
        | - build
            | - <Initially empty>

Within `<Workspace Dir>/build` run...

- [Debug] `cmake -G Ninja ..`
- [Debug with Code Coverage] `cmake -G Ninja -D CppCommon_CODE_COVERAGE=ON ..`
- [Release] `cmake -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`

Once CMake has generated the build files, within `<WorkSpace Dir>/build` run...

- [Build] `cmake --build .` or `ninja -v` (if the build generator was Ninja)
- [Test] `ctest --parallel`
